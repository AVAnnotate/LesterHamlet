The embargo limits U.S. businesses from trading with Cuba, restricts travel, and blocks financial transactions, though it allows some exceptions for humanitarian goods like food and medicine. Despite its long duration, the embargo remains a contentious issue, with debates over its effectiveness and impact on the Cuban people."
